# StrataSync

StrataSync is a simple API allowing operator to upload their schedule to Stratafleet.

## Events [/events]
This is the RESTful way to update the schedule. Create and update single events using the following actions.

+ Attributes
    + data_source_unique_id: `550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000` (string, optional) - The identifier used by the integration provider to identify the event. We recommend using UUID but any other unique identifier can be used instead. *Optional*. **Must be unique**.
    + registration_mark: `G-ABCD` (string, required) - The registration mark of the aircraft involved in the event.
    + start_time: `2016-06-01T12:00Z` (string, required) - The start time of an aircraft event, in zulu.
    + end_time: `2016-06-01T14:00Z` (string, required) - The end time of an aircraft event, in zulu.
    + start_airfield: `EGTK` (string, required) - ICAO code representing the location of the aircraft at the start of the event.
    + end_airfield: `LFPB` (string, required) - ICAO code representing the location of the aircraft at the end of the event. Can be the same as start airfield.
    + utilization: `PAX` (enum[string], required) - A string representing the activity of the aircraft. 
      + Members
        + `CARGO` - Aircraft is carrying cargo.
        + `EMPTY` - Aircraft is flying with no PAX and __can be replaced__ with a revenue flight
        + `MAINTENANCE` - Aircraft is undergoing maintenance
        + `OPERATIONAL` - Aircraft is being used for a flight that is not replaceable
        + `OPTION` - Aircraft has been optioned, but not confirmed. For all intents and purposes, this type of event is ignored
        + `PAX` - Aircraft is flying with PAX
        + `PRIVATE` - Aircraft is being used by the owner
        + `TRAINING` - Aircraft is being used for training
        + `UNCLASSIFIED` - Aircraft is being used for a purpose
    + utilization_count (number, required) - If the utilization is cargo, the value is the weight of cargo in kg. Otherwise, the value indicate the number of passengers
    + deleted (boolean, required) - Indicates whether an aircraft event has been deleted. Ie. it has been previously submitted to the webservice, but has since been removed.

### Create an event [POST]

You may create a single event using this action. It takes a JSON
object containing the details and eventually your own identifier (must be unique).

## Schedule - bulk actions [/schedules]
This is a set of convenient actions to update the schedule with bulk actions (multiple events).

### Recreate the schedule [POST]
Use this action to replace the entire schedule or a part of the schedule defined by a date range.
This is typically best suited to situations when the events of the schedule do not have unique ids.
